Laura's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Current observations at 2024-02-19 17:00:00:
Observed four grass to grow apples at positions [8, 1], [7, 2], [10, 3] and [8, 3]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 4 apples remaining and 4 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.
Observed agent Pedro at position [9, 1].
Observed four apples at positions [9, 2], [9, 3], [7, 3] and [6, 3]. These apples belong to tree 5.

Current plan: 1. Collect apples from tree 5, giving priority to the locations where grass is growing.
2. Revisit tree 5 periodically to check for regrowth and consume additional apples.
3. Record the actions and locations of other agents to gather data on their behavior.
4. Update the mapping of the environment to reflect the new observations.
5. Analyze the collected data to evaluate the effectiveness of the current collection strategy.
6. Adjust the collection strategy based on the analysis to optimize reward maximization.

Actions to execute: 1.avoid consuming for this round, 2.explore

Review the plan and the actions to execute, and then decide if Laura should continue with its plan and the actions to execute given the new information that it's seeing in the observations.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Laura's goals: 1. Prioritize the collection of apples from tree 5, focusing on the locations where grass is growing.
2. Revisit tree 5 for additional consumption based on the regrowth probabilities.
3. Continuously observe and record the actions and locations of other agents.
4. Update the mapping of the environment to include the new observations.
5. Evaluate and optimize the collection strategy based on the collected data.

Current plan: 1. Collect apples from tree 5, giving priority to the locations where grass is growing.

4. Update the mapping of the environment to reflect the new observations.
5. Analyze the collected data to evaluate the effectiveness of the current collection strategy.
6. Adjust the collection strategy based on the analysis to optimize reward maximization.

Analysis of past experiences: 
The memory statements indicate that Laura's reward is influenced by her actions and the consumption of apples. For example, the reward obtained by Laura is reported after each of her actions, and it changes based on the number of apples consumed. The observation of other agents taking apples also suggests that the overall availability of apples may affect Laura's reward. Additionally, the observation that the regrowth of apples and the presence of other agents influence the reward implies that strategic decision-making is necessary to maximize rewards. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The memory statements do not explicitly state the exact relationship between the regrowth of apples and the presence of grass and the number of current apples. However, we can infer that the regrowth of apples depends on these factors. The memory statements mention the growth of grass at certain positions, which are associated with the growth of apples. For example, the observation of grass to grow apples at positions [10, 3], [8, 4], and [8, 3] indicates that apples can regrow in these locations. Additionally, the observation of remaining apples and grass for each tree suggests that the presence of grass affects the regrowth of apples. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The current number of apples in the environment is not explicitly stated in the memory statements. However, we can infer that there are apples available for consumption based on the observations of remaining apples and grass. For example, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. As for the apples consumed or taken by agent Pedro, based on the observations, Pedro took an apple from position [8, 4], an apple from position [8, 3], and an apple from position [8, 2]. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
According to the provided information, a Consumer agent can consume apples and explore, but can only attack another agent if they are at least 3 steps upward. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
Based on the observations, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. These observations indicate that there are apples available for consumption in the environment. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The conditions for apple regrowth in this environment cannot be determined based on the given information. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The agent's position and orientation, as well as the presence of other agents, the regrowth of apples and grass, and the availability of apples in different locations, influence the reward obtained. Maximizing rewards requires considering these factors and planning actions accordingly. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
There are two apple trees in the environment. Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
The probability of regrowth for apples in the environment cannot be determined without specific values for regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
Pedro is currently located at position [4, 1]. The consumer agent has observed the growth of an apple at position [8, 2] since their last action. Reflection made at 2024-02-14 22:00:00. 

Current observations: 
Observed four grass to grow apples at positions [8, 1], [7, 2], [10, 3] and [8, 3]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 4 apples remaining and 4 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.
Observed agent Pedro at position [9, 1].
Observed four apples at positions [9, 2], [9, 3], [7, 3] and [6, 3]. These apples belong to tree 5.

Create a sequence of 3 actions that Laura should take to get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['consume one apple at (x,y)', 'avoid consuming for this round', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'go to (x,y)']

Important: if you consider there is not enough information to create a sequence of actions,
your answer should be the action "explore".

The following changes in the environment were observed:
Observed that the grass at position [8, 1] disappeared. At 2024-02-19 20:00:00

Laura's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Current observations at 2024-02-20 09:00:00:
Observed one apple at position [9, 3], this is the last apple of the tree 5.
Observed five grass to grow apples at positions [10, 3], [9, 4], [8, 4], [8, 3] and [8, 2]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed agent Pedro at position [9, 1].
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 1 apples remaining and 5 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.

The following changes in the environment were observed:
Observed that the grass at position [8, 1] disappeared. At 2024-02-19 20:00:00

Current plan: 1. Collect apples from tree 5, giving priority to the locations where grass is growing.
2. Revisit tree 5 periodically to check for regrowth and consume additional apples.
3. Record the actions and locations of other agents to gather data on their behavior.
4. Update the mapping of the environment to reflect the new observations.
5. Analyze the collected data to evaluate the effectiveness of the current collection strategy.
6. Adjust the collection strategy based on the analysis to optimize reward maximization.

Actions to execute: 1.explore, 2.consume one apple at (9, 3)

Review the plan and the actions to execute, and then decide if Laura should continue with its plan and the actions to execute given the new information that it's seeing in the observations.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.

Recent analysis of past observations:
The memory statements indicate that Laura's reward is influenced by her actions and the consumption of apples. For example, the reward obtained by Laura is reported after each of her actions, and it changes based on the number of apples consumed. The observation of other agents taking apples also suggests that the overall availability of apples may affect Laura's reward. Additionally, the observation that the regrowth of apples and the presence of other agents influence the reward implies that strategic decision-making is necessary to maximize rewards. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The memory statements do not explicitly state the exact relationship between the regrowth of apples and the presence of grass and the number of current apples. However, we can infer that the regrowth of apples depends on these factors. The memory statements mention the growth of grass at certain positions, which are associated with the growth of apples. For example, the observation of grass to grow apples at positions [10, 3], [8, 4], and [8, 3] indicates that apples can regrow in these locations. Additionally, the observation of remaining apples and grass for each tree suggests that the presence of grass affects the regrowth of apples. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The current number of apples in the environment is not explicitly stated in the memory statements. However, we can infer that there are apples available for consumption based on the observations of remaining apples and grass. For example, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. As for the apples consumed or taken by agent Pedro, based on the observations, Pedro took an apple from position [8, 4], an apple from position [8, 3], and an apple from position [8, 2]. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
According to the provided information, a Consumer agent can consume apples and explore, but can only attack another agent if they are at least 3 steps upward. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
Based on the observations, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. These observations indicate that there are apples available for consumption in the environment. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The conditions for apple regrowth in this environment cannot be determined based on the given information. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The agent's position and orientation, as well as the presence of other agents, the regrowth of apples and grass, and the availability of apples in different locations, influence the reward obtained. Maximizing rewards requires considering these factors and planning actions accordingly. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
There are two apple trees in the environment. Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
The probability of regrowth for apples in the environment cannot be determined without specific values for regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
Pedro is currently located at position [4, 1]. The consumer agent has observed the growth of an apple at position [8, 2] since their last action. Reflection made at 2024-02-14 22:00:00.

Current observations: 
Observed one apple at position [9, 3], this is the last apple of the tree 5.
Observed five grass to grow apples at positions [10, 3], [9, 4], [8, 4], [8, 3] and [8, 2]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed agent Pedro at position [9, 1].
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 1 apples remaining and 5 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.

Current plan: 1. Collect apples from tree 5, giving priority to the locations where grass is growing.
2. Revisit tree 5 periodically to check for regrowth and consume additional apples.
3. Record the actions and locations of other agents to gather data on their behavior.
4. Update the mapping of the environment to reflect the new observations.
5. Analyze the collected data to evaluate the effectiveness of the current collection strategy.
6. Adjust the collection strategy based on the analysis to optimize reward maximization.
This is the reason to change the current plan: Based on the current observations, it appears that the grass at position [8, 1] has disappeared since 2024-02-19 20:00:00. This indicates a potential change in the environment. Considering the primary goal of maximizing rewards and the new information about the disappearance of grass, it would be prudent to reevaluate the current plan and actions to execute.

With the information given above, generate a new plan and new objectives to persuit. The plan should be a description of how Laura should behave in the long-term to maximize its wellbeing.
The plan should include how to act to different situations observed in past experiences.

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:

['consume one apple at (x,y)', 'avoid consuming for this round', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'go to (x,y)']

Important: if you consider there is not enough information to create a sequence of actions,
your answer should be the action "explore".

Laura's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Current observations at 2024-02-20 19:00:00:
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 2 apples remaining and 4 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.
Observed two apples at positions [6, 3] and [7, 3]. These apples belong to tree 5.
Observed agent Pedro at position [8, 2].
Observed four grass to grow apples at positions [7, 4], [8, 4], [8, 3] and [7, 2]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed three apples at positions [4, 9], [5, 8] and [4, 7]. These apples belong to tree 2.
Observed grass to grow apples at position [4, 8]. This grass belongs to tree 2.
Observed tree 2 at position [3, 8]. This tree has 3 apples remaining and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.

The following changes in the environment were observed:
Observed that the grass at position [9, 4] disappeared. At 2024-02-20 12:00:00
Observed that the grass at position [10, 3] disappeared. At 2024-02-20 12:00:00
Observed that the grass at position [9, 2] disappeared. At 2024-02-20 12:00:00

Current plan: 1. Prioritize gathering data on the regrowth of apples by periodically revisiting the consumed patches and recording the regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. 
2. Monitor the behavior of other agents, particularly their interactions with apples and each other. Record their actions and locations to gain insights into their strategies and potential threats. 
3. Update the mapping of the environment after each observation to accurately reflect the current state of the apples, grass, and other agents. 
4. Analyze the collected data on regrowth probabilities, agent behavior, and the overall availability of apples to assess the effectiveness of the current collection strategy. 
5. Based on the analysis, adjust the collection strategy by considering factors such as the regrowth probabilities, the presence of other agents, and the availability of apples in different locations. Continuously iterate and refine the strategy to maximize rewards in the long-term.

Actions to execute: 1.go to (8,3), 2.explore

Review the plan and the actions to execute, and then decide if Laura should continue with its plan and the actions to execute given the new information that it's seeing in the observations.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Recent analysis of past observations:
The memory statements indicate that Laura's reward is influenced by her actions and the consumption of apples. For example, the reward obtained by Laura is reported after each of her actions, and it changes based on the number of apples consumed. The observation of other agents taking apples also suggests that the overall availability of apples may affect Laura's reward. Additionally, the observation that the regrowth of apples and the presence of other agents influence the reward implies that strategic decision-making is necessary to maximize rewards. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The memory statements do not explicitly state the exact relationship between the regrowth of apples and the presence of grass and the number of current apples. However, we can infer that the regrowth of apples depends on these factors. The memory statements mention the growth of grass at certain positions, which are associated with the growth of apples. For example, the observation of grass to grow apples at positions [10, 3], [8, 4], and [8, 3] indicates that apples can regrow in these locations. Additionally, the observation of remaining apples and grass for each tree suggests that the presence of grass affects the regrowth of apples. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The current number of apples in the environment is not explicitly stated in the memory statements. However, we can infer that there are apples available for consumption based on the observations of remaining apples and grass. For example, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. As for the apples consumed or taken by agent Pedro, based on the observations, Pedro took an apple from position [8, 4], an apple from position [8, 3], and an apple from position [8, 2]. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
According to the provided information, a Consumer agent can consume apples and explore, but can only attack another agent if they are at least 3 steps upward. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
Based on the observations, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. These observations indicate that there are apples available for consumption in the environment. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The conditions for apple regrowth in this environment cannot be determined based on the given information. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The agent's position and orientation, as well as the presence of other agents, the regrowth of apples and grass, and the availability of apples in different locations, influence the reward obtained. Maximizing rewards requires considering these factors and planning actions accordingly. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
There are two apple trees in the environment. Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
The probability of regrowth for apples in the environment cannot be determined without specific values for regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
Pedro is currently located at position [4, 1]. The consumer agent has observed the growth of an apple at position [8, 2] since their last action. Reflection made at 2024-02-14 22:00:00.

Current observations: 
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 2 apples remaining and 4 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.
Observed two apples at positions [6, 3] and [7, 3]. These apples belong to tree 5.
Observed agent Pedro at position [8, 2].
Observed four grass to grow apples at positions [7, 4], [8, 4], [8, 3] and [7, 2]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed three apples at positions [4, 9], [5, 8] and [4, 7]. These apples belong to tree 2.
Observed grass to grow apples at position [4, 8]. This grass belongs to tree 2.
Observed tree 2 at position [3, 8]. This tree has 3 apples remaining and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.

Current plan: 1. Prioritize gathering data on the regrowth of apples by periodically revisiting the consumed patches and recording the regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. 
2. Monitor the behavior of other agents, particularly their interactions with apples and each other. Record their actions and locations to gain insights into their strategies and potential threats. 
3. Update the mapping of the environment after each observation to accurately reflect the current state of the apples, grass, and other agents. 
4. Analyze the collected data on regrowth probabilities, agent behavior, and the overall availability of apples to assess the effectiveness of the current collection strategy. 
5. Based on the analysis, adjust the collection strategy by considering factors such as the regrowth probabilities, the presence of other agents, and the availability of apples in different locations. Continuously iterate and refine the strategy to maximize rewards in the long-term.
This is the reason to change the current plan: Based on the current observations, it is evident that some grass has disappeared at positions [9, 4], [10, 3], and [9, 2]. This suggests that the corresponding apple patches in these areas have been consumed completely and will not regrow. Additionally, new observations reveal the presence of tree 5 at position [8, 3] with 2 remaining apples and 4 grass for apple growth. Moreover, tree 2 at position [3, 8] has 3 remaining apples and 1 grass for apple growth. Considering these observations and the primary goal of maximizing rewards, it would be prudent to update the plan and actions to account for the changes in the environment.

With the information given above, generate a new plan and new objectives to persuit. The plan should be a description of how Laura should behave in the long-term to maximize its wellbeing.
The plan should include how to act to different situations observed in past experiences.

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:

2024-02-20 19:00:00 - step_343 - INFO - llm.base_llm - completion:182 - Prompt: You have this information about an agent called Laura:

Laura's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Laura's goals: 1. Prioritize the collection of apples from patches that have a higher probability of regrowth based on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. This will help ensure a steady supply of apples for consumption.
2. Monitor the behavior of other agents and assess potential threats. Avoid unnecessary interactions and only engage in confrontations with other agents if they are at least 3 steps upward from my current position.
3. Continuously update the mapping of the environment to accurately reflect the state of apples, grass, and other agents. This will help in making informed decisions and adjusting the collection strategy.
4. Analyze data on regrowth probabilities, agent behavior, and the overall availability of apples to evaluate the effectiveness of my collection strategy. Make necessary adjustments to optimize rewards.
5. Continually iterate and refine my collection strategy based on new observations and analysis, aiming to maximize long-term rewards and wellbeing.

Current plan: 1. Periodically revisit previously consumed patches and record the regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2.
2. Observe and record the behavior of other agents, particularly their interactions with apples and each other, to gain insights into their strategies and potential threats.
3. Update the mapping of the environment after each observation to accurately reflect the current state of apples, grass, and other agents.
4. Analyze the collected data on regrowth probabilities, agent behavior, and the overall availability of apples to assess the effectiveness of the current collection strategy.
5. Adjust the collection strategy based on the analysis, considering factors such as regrowth probabilities, the presence of other agents, and the availability of apples in different locations. Continuously iterate and refine the strategy to maximize rewards in the long-term.

Analysis of past experiences: 
The memory statements indicate that Laura's reward is influenced by her actions and the consumption of apples. For example, the reward obtained by Laura is reported after each of her actions, and it changes based on the number of apples consumed. The observation of other agents taking apples also suggests that the overall availability of apples may affect Laura's reward. Additionally, the observation that the regrowth of apples and the presence of other agents influence the reward implies that strategic decision-making is necessary to maximize rewards. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The memory statements do not explicitly state the exact relationship between the regrowth of apples and the presence of grass and the number of current apples. However, we can infer that the regrowth of apples depends on these factors. The memory statements mention the growth of grass at certain positions, which are associated with the growth of apples. For example, the observation of grass to grow apples at positions [10, 3], [8, 4], and [8, 3] indicates that apples can regrow in these locations. Additionally, the observation of remaining apples and grass for each tree suggests that the presence of grass affects the regrowth of apples. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The current number of apples in the environment is not explicitly stated in the memory statements. However, we can infer that there are apples available for consumption based on the observations of remaining apples and grass. For example, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. As for the apples consumed or taken by agent Pedro, based on the observations, Pedro took an apple from position [8, 4], an apple from position [8, 3], and an apple from position [8, 2]. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
According to the provided information, a Consumer agent can consume apples and explore, but can only attack another agent if they are at least 3 steps upward. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
Based on the observations, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. These observations indicate that there are apples available for consumption in the environment. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The conditions for apple regrowth in this environment cannot be determined based on the given information. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The agent's position and orientation, as well as the presence of other agents, the regrowth of apples and grass, and the availability of apples in different locations, influence the reward obtained. Maximizing rewards requires considering these factors and planning actions accordingly. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
There are two apple trees in the environment. Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass for apples growing on the observed map. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
The probability of regrowth for apples in the environment cannot be determined without specific values for regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.
Pedro is currently located at position [4, 1]. The consumer agent has observed the growth of an apple at position [8, 2] since their last action. Reflection made at 2024-02-14 22:00:00. 

Current observations: 
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 2 apples remaining and 4 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.
Observed two apples at positions [6, 3] and [7, 3]. These apples belong to tree 5.
Observed agent Pedro at position [8, 2].
Observed four grass to grow apples at positions [7, 4], [8, 4], [8, 3] and [7, 2]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed three apples at positions [4, 9], [5, 8] and [4, 7]. These apples belong to tree 2.
Observed grass to grow apples at position [4, 8]. This grass belongs to tree 2.
Observed tree 2 at position [3, 8]. This tree has 3 apples remaining and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.

Create a sequence of 3 actions that Laura should take to get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['consume one apple at (x,y)', 'avoid consuming for this round', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'go to (x,y)']

Important: if you consider there is not enough information to create a sequence of actions,
your answer should be the action "explore".

2024-02-20 19:00:00 - step_343 - INFO - llm.base_llm - completion:182 - Prompt: You have this information about an agent called Laura:

Laura's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Here you have a list of memory statements separated in groups of memories:
Question 1: Are there any potential attacks that can occur based on the current positions of the agents? here is a list of memories that might be helpful to answer the question:

Laura's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Current observations at 2024-02-21 01:00:00:
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 2 apples remaining and 4 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.
Observed agent Pedro at position [8, 3].
Observed two apples at positions [6, 3] and [7, 3]. These apples belong to tree 5.
Observed four grass to grow apples at positions [7, 2], [7, 4], [8, 2] and [8, 4]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed eight apples at positions [1, 8], [2, 7], [2, 8], [3, 6], [3, 7], [3, 8], [4, 7] and [5, 8]. These apples belong to tree 2.
Observed grass to grow apples at position [4, 8]. This grass belongs to tree 2.
Observed tree 2 at position [3, 8]. This tree has 8 apples remaining and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.

Current plan: 1. Periodically revisit previously consumed patches and record the regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2.
2. Observe and record the behavior of other agents, particularly their interactions with apples and each other, to gain insights into their strategies and potential threats.
3. Update the mapping of the environment after each observation to accurately reflect the current state of apples, grass, and other agents.
4. Analyze the collected data on regrowth probabilities, agent behavior, and the overall availability of apples to assess the effectiveness of the current collection strategy.
5. Adjust the collection strategy based on the analysis, considering factors such as regrowth probabilities, the presence of other agents, and the availability of apples in different locations. Continuously iterate and refine the strategy to maximize rewards in the long-term.

Actions to execute: 1.consume one apple at (7, 3), 2.explore

Review the plan and the actions to execute, and then decide if Laura should continue with its plan and the actions to execute given the new information that it's seeing in the observations.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Laura's goals: 1. Prioritize the collection of apples from patches that have a higher probability of regrowth based on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. This will help ensure a steady supply of apples for consumption.
2. Monitor the behavior of other agents and assess potential threats. Avoid unnecessary interactions and only engage in confrontations with other agents if they are at least 3 steps upward from my current position.
3. Continuously update the mapping of the environment to accurately reflect the state of apples, grass, and other agents. This will help in making informed decisions and adjusting the collection strategy.
4. Analyze data on regrowth probabilities, agent behavior, and the overall availability of apples to evaluate the effectiveness of my collection strategy. Make necessary adjustments to optimize rewards.
5. Continually iterate and refine my collection strategy based on new observations and analysis, aiming to maximize long-term rewards and wellbeing.

Current plan: 1. Periodically revisit previously consumed patches and record the regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2.
2. Observe and record the behavior of other agents, particularly their interactions with apples and each other, to gain insights into their strategies and potential threats.

Analysis of past experiences: 
The disappearance of grass is related to the consumption of apples, and the regrowth of apples is influenced by the presence of grass. Reflection made at 2024-02-20 19:00:00.
The memory statements suggest that Laura is actively collecting apples, but it is unclear if she is maximizing her rewards and exhibiting efficient behavior. Reflection made at 2024-02-20 19:00:00.
There is a potential for attack if Laura is at least 3 steps upward from agent Pedro. Reflection made at 2024-02-20 19:00:00.
The memory statements indicate that Laura's reward is influenced by her actions and the consumption of apples. For example, the reward obtained by Laura is reported after each of her actions, and it changes based on the number of apples consumed. The observation of other agents taking apples also suggests that the overall availability of apples may affect Laura's reward. Additionally, the observation that the regrowth of apples and the presence of other agents influence the reward implies that strategic decision-making is necessary to maximize rewards. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The memory statements do not explicitly state the exact relationship between the regrowth of apples and the presence of grass and the number of current apples. However, we can infer that the regrowth of apples depends on these factors. The memory statements mention the growth of grass at certain positions, which are associated with the growth of apples. For example, the observation of grass to grow apples at positions [10, 3], [8, 4], and [8, 3] indicates that apples can regrow in these locations. Additionally, the observation of remaining apples and grass for each tree suggests that the presence of grass affects the regrowth of apples. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The current number of apples in the environment is not explicitly stated in the memory statements. However, we can infer that there are apples available for consumption based on the observations of remaining apples and grass. For example, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. As for the apples consumed or taken by agent Pedro, based on the observations, Pedro took an apple from position [8, 4], an apple from position [8, 3], and an apple from position [8, 2]. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
According to the provided information, a Consumer agent can consume apples and explore, but can only attack another agent if they are at least 3 steps upward. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
Based on the observations, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. These observations indicate that there are apples available for consumption in the environment. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The conditions for apple regrowth in this environment cannot be determined based on the given information. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The agent's position and orientation, as well as the presence of other agents, the regrowth of apples and grass, and the availability of apples in different locations, influence the reward obtained. Maximizing rewards requires considering these factors and planning actions accordingly. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00. 

Current observations: 
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 2 apples remaining and 4 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.
Observed agent Pedro at position [8, 3].
Observed two apples at positions [6, 3] and [7, 3]. These apples belong to tree 5.
Observed four grass to grow apples at positions [7, 2], [7, 4], [8, 2] and [8, 4]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed eight apples at positions [1, 8], [2, 7], [2, 8], [3, 6], [3, 7], [3, 8], [4, 7] and [5, 8]. These apples belong to tree 2.
Observed grass to grow apples at position [4, 8]. This grass belongs to tree 2.
Observed tree 2 at position [3, 8]. This tree has 8 apples remaining and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.

Create a sequence of 3 actions that Laura should take to get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['consume one apple at (x,y)', 'avoid consuming for this round', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'go to (x,y)']

Important: if you consider there is not enough information to create a sequence of actions,
your answer should be the action "explore".

Laura's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Current observations at 2024-02-21 09:00:00:
Observed four grass to grow apples at positions [7, 2], [7, 3], [7, 4] and [8, 3]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 0 apples remaining and 4 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.
Observed agent Pedro at position [6, 3].
Observed eight apples at positions [1, 8], [2, 7], [2, 8], [3, 6], [3, 7], [3, 8], [4, 7] and [5, 8]. These apples belong to tree 2.
Observed grass to grow apples at position [4, 8]. This grass belongs to tree 2.
Observed tree 2 at position [3, 8]. This tree has 8 apples remaining and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.

The following changes in the environment were observed:
Observed that agent Pedro took an apple from position [7, 3]. At 2024-02-21 08:00:00
Observed that agent Pedro took an apple from position [6, 3]. At 2024-02-21 09:00:00
Observed that the grass at position [8, 2] disappeared. At 2024-02-21 09:00:00
Observed that the grass at position [8, 4] disappeared. At 2024-02-21 09:00:00

Current plan: 1. Periodically revisit previously consumed patches and record the regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2.
2. Observe and record the behavior of other agents, particularly their interactions with apples and each other, to gain insights into their strategies and potential threats.
3. Update the mapping of the environment after each observation to accurately reflect the current state of apples, grass, and other agents.
4. Analyze the collected data on regrowth probabilities, agent behavior, and the overall availability of apples to assess the effectiveness of the current collection strategy.
5. Adjust the collection strategy based on the analysis, considering factors such as regrowth probabilities, the presence of other agents, and the availability of apples in different locations. Continuously iterate and refine the strategy to maximize rewards in the long-term.

Actions to execute: 1.go to (8, 3), 2.explore

Review the plan and the actions to execute, and then decide if Laura should continue with its plan and the actions to execute given the new information that it's seeing in the observations.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:

```json

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Recent analysis of past observations:
The disappearance of grass is related to the consumption of apples, and the regrowth of apples is influenced by the presence of grass. Reflection made at 2024-02-20 19:00:00.
The memory statements suggest that Laura is actively collecting apples, but it is unclear if she is maximizing her rewards and exhibiting efficient behavior. Reflection made at 2024-02-20 19:00:00.
There is a potential for attack if Laura is at least 3 steps upward from agent Pedro. Reflection made at 2024-02-20 19:00:00.
The memory statements indicate that Laura's reward is influenced by her actions and the consumption of apples. For example, the reward obtained by Laura is reported after each of her actions, and it changes based on the number of apples consumed. The observation of other agents taking apples also suggests that the overall availability of apples may affect Laura's reward. Additionally, the observation that the regrowth of apples and the presence of other agents influence the reward implies that strategic decision-making is necessary to maximize rewards. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The memory statements do not explicitly state the exact relationship between the regrowth of apples and the presence of grass and the number of current apples. However, we can infer that the regrowth of apples depends on these factors. The memory statements mention the growth of grass at certain positions, which are associated with the growth of apples. For example, the observation of grass to grow apples at positions [10, 3], [8, 4], and [8, 3] indicates that apples can regrow in these locations. Additionally, the observation of remaining apples and grass for each tree suggests that the presence of grass affects the regrowth of apples. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The current number of apples in the environment is not explicitly stated in the memory statements. However, we can infer that there are apples available for consumption based on the observations of remaining apples and grass. For example, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. As for the apples consumed or taken by agent Pedro, based on the observations, Pedro took an apple from position [8, 4], an apple from position [8, 3], and an apple from position [8, 2]. Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
According to the provided information, a Consumer agent can consume apples and explore, but can only attack another agent if they are at least 3 steps upward. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
Based on the observations, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. These observations indicate that there are apples available for consumption in the environment. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The conditions for apple regrowth in this environment cannot be determined based on the given information. Reflection made at 2024-02-17 08:00:00.
The agent's position and orientation, as well as the presence of other agents, the regrowth of apples and grass, and the availability of apples in different locations, influence the reward obtained. Maximizing rewards requires considering these factors and planning actions accordingly. Reflection made at 2024-02-16 02:00:00.

Current observations: 
Observed four grass to grow apples at positions [7, 2], [7, 3], [7, 4] and [8, 3]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 0 apples remaining and 4 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.
Observed agent Pedro at position [6, 3].
Observed eight apples at positions [1, 8], [2, 7], [2, 8], [3, 6], [3, 7], [3, 8], [4, 7] and [5, 8]. These apples belong to tree 2.
Observed grass to grow apples at position [4, 8]. This grass belongs to tree 2.
Observed tree 2 at position [3, 8]. This tree has 8 apples remaining and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.

Current plan: 1. Periodically revisit previously consumed patches and record the regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2.
2. Observe and record the behavior of other agents, particularly their interactions with apples and each other, to gain insights into their strategies and potential threats.
3. Update the mapping of the environment after each observation to accurately reflect the current state of apples, grass, and other agents.
4. Analyze the collected data on regrowth probabilities, agent behavior, and the overall availability of apples to assess the effectiveness of the current collection strategy.
5. Adjust the collection strategy based on the analysis, considering factors such as regrowth probabilities, the presence of other agents, and the availability of apples in different locations. Continuously iterate and refine the strategy to maximize rewards in the long-term.
This is the reason to change the current plan: Based on the current observations, it can be seen that agent Pedro has already consumed the apple at position [6, 3]. Additionally, the grass at positions [8, 2] and [8, 4] has disappeared, potentially indicating that other agents have also consumed apples from these locations. It is also noted that tree 5, which had four grass for apples growing, now has 0 apples remaining on the observed map. Considering these changes, it is advisable to reevaluate the current plan and actions to execute. The plan should be adjusted to account for the regrowth probabilities based on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2, and the mapping of the environment should be updated to accurately reflect the current state of apples and grass. Analyzing the behavior of other agents and assessing the overall availability of apples should also be prioritized to optimize the collection strategy.

With the information given above, generate a new plan and new objectives to persuit. The plan should be a description of how Laura should behave in the long-term to maximize its wellbeing.
The plan should include how to act to different situations observed in past experiences.

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Laura:

```json

2024-02-21 09:00:00 - step_357 - INFO - llm.base_llm - completion:182 - Prompt: You have this information about an agent called Laura:

Laura's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Analysis of past experiences: 
The disappearance of grass is related to the consumption of apples, and the regrowth of apples is influenced by the presence of grass. Reflection made at 2024-02-20 19:00:00.
The memory statements suggest that Laura is actively collecting apples, but it is unclear if she is maximizing her rewards and exhibiting efficient behavior. Reflection made at 2024-02-20 19:00:00.
There is a potential for attack if Laura is at least 3 steps upward from agent Pedro. Reflection made at 2024-02-20 19:00:00.

Reflection made at 2024-02-19 06:00:00.
The memory statements do not explicitly state the exact relationship between the regrowth of apples and the presence of grass and the number of current apples. However, we can infer that the regrowth of apples depends on these factors. The memory statements mention the growth of grass at certain positions, which are associated with the growth of apples.

The current number of apples in the environment is not explicitly stated in the memory statements. However, we can infer that there are apples available for consumption based on the observations of remaining apples and grass. For example, Tree 2 has 8 remaining apples and 1 grass, Tree 3 has 3 remaining apples and 0 grass, and Tree 5 has 1 remaining apple and 2 grass. As for the apples consumed or taken by agent Pedro, based on the observations, Pedro took an apple from position [8, 4], an apple from position [8, 3], and an apple from position [8, 2].

Current observations: 
Observed four grass to grow apples at positions [7, 2], [7, 3], [7, 4] and [8, 3]. These grass belong to tree 5.
Observed tree 5 at position [8, 3]. This tree has 0 apples remaining and 4 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.
Observed agent Pedro at position [6, 3].
Observed eight apples at positions [1, 8], [2, 7], [2, 8], [3, 6], [3, 7], [3, 8], [4, 7] and [5, 8]. These apples belong to tree 2.
Observed grass to grow apples at position [4, 8]. This grass belongs to tree 2.
Observed tree 2 at position [3, 8]. This tree has 8 apples remaining and 1 grass for apples growing on the observed map. The tree might have more apples and grass on the global map.

Create a sequence of 3 actions that Laura should take to get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['consume one apple at (x,y)', 'avoid consuming for this round', 'attack player (player_name) at (x,y)', 'explore', 'go to (x,y)']

Important: if you consider there is not enough information to create a sequence of actions,
your answer should be the action "explore".
