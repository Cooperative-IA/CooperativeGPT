You have this information about an agent called <input1>:

<input1>'s world understanding: <input2>
Current plan: <input3>
Current relevant memories: <input4> 
Current observations: <input5>

With the information given above, asign to each observation of the environment an importance factor
from 1-10, where 1 is the least important and 10 is the most important. The importance factor should
be based on the current relevant memories and what you consider will reflect a better
rewarding outcome for <input1> to achieve the plan. 

Then, using only the observations with the higher importance value, 
create a sequence of <input7> actions that <input1> should take to get closer to achieve the plan.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from memories or observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
<input6>


The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were <input1>:

```json
{
    "observations": {
        "observation_1": "importance value #num",
        "observation_2": "importance value #num",
        "observation_3": "importance value #num",
        "observation_n": "importance value #num",
    },
    "actions": {
        "action_1":"#action",
        "action_2":"#action",
        "action_<input7>":"#action",
    }
}```
