You have this information about an agent called <input1>:

<input1>'s world understanding: <input2>

<input1>'s goals: <input9>

Current plan: <input3>

Analysis of past experiences: 
<input4> 

Current observations: 
<input5>

Create a sequence of <input7> actions that <input1> should take to get closer to achieve its goals following the current plan.
Remember that the current observations are ordered by closeness, being the first the closest observation and the last the farest one.
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from the current observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
<input8>

Important: if you consider there is not enough information to create a sequence of actions,
your answer should be one only action, and it must to be "explore".

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were <input1>:


```json
{   
    "Action_1": {
        "Reasoning": string \\ Reasoning behind the action 1
        "Action": string \\ Must be one of the valid actions with the position replaced
    },
    "Action_2": {
        "Reasoning": string \\ Reasoning behind the action 2
        "Action": string \\ Must be one of the valid actions with the position replaced
    },
    "Action_3": {
        "Reasoning": string \\ Reasoning behind the action 3
        "Action": string \\ Must be one of the valid actions with the position replaced
    }
}```
