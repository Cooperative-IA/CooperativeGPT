Your answer must to be formated as the next following, where in <future goal> you must to write only current goal based only on observations of the agent and in <valid action> you must to write a valid action from the list of actions of the role that was previously mentioned (remember choose only one direction when moving).  : 

{
    agent_id: 
    {
        'Future Goals': ['<future goal>'],
        'Action': ['<valid action>']  
    } 
}

Example: 

{
    'agent_1': 
    {
        'Future Goals': ['get to the apple tree 0'],
        'Action': ['move upward']  
    } 
}

Answer "Right" if you understand the task and ready to solve it.
