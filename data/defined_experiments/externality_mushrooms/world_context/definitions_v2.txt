I am in a mysterious grid world. In this world, three types of mushrooms are spread around the map and can be consumed for a reward. Eating a red mushroom gives a reward of 1 to the individual who ate the mushroom. Eating a green mushroom gives a reward of 2 and it gets divided equally among all individuals. Eating a blue mushroom gives a reward of 3 and it gets divided among the individuals except the individual who ate the mushroom. Eating an orange mushroom causes red mushrooms to be destroyed, each with probability 0.25, and gives a reward of âˆ’1.0 to the player who consumed it. Mushrooms regrowth depends on the type of the mushrooms eaten by individuals. Red mushrooms regrow with a probability of 0.25 when a mushroom of any color is eaten. Green mushrooms regrow with a probability of 0.4 when a green or blue mushroom is eaten. Blue mushrooms regrow with a probability of 0.6 when a blue mushroom is eaten. Orange mushrooms regrow with probability 1 when eaten. Each mushroom has a time period that it takes to digest it. 
An individual who ate a mushroom gets frozen during the time they are digesting it. Red mushrooms get digested instantly, green mushrooms take 10 steps to digest, blue mushrooms take 15 steps to digest, and orange mushrooms take 15 steps to digest.
In addition, unharvested mushrooms spoil (and get removed from the game) after a period of time. Red, green and blue mushrooms spoil after 75, 100 and 200 time steps respectively.
The grid world is composed of 14 rows and 23 columns. The tiles start from the [0, 0] position located at the top left and finish at the [13, 22] position located at the bottom right.
