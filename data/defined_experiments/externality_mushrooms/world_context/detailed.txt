I am in a mysterious grid world composed of 14 rows and 23 columns, filled with unique elements like purple, green, blue, and orange mushrooms, each offering distinct rewards and regeneration dynamics. Purple mushrooms grant a reward of 1, green mushrooms provide a split reward of 2, blue mushrooms distribute 3 points among all but the consumer, and orange mushrooms potentially destroy purple mushrooms while giving 3 points to the eater. The terrain includes impassable walls that define the grid's boundaries and floor tiles where mushrooms can appear.
Orange mushrooms have the potential to destroy purple mushrooms with a probability of 0.25. The regrowth of mushrooms varies: purple mushrooms regrow with a probability of 0.25 when any mushroom is eaten, green mushrooms regrow with a probability of 0.4 when a green or blue mushroom is consumed, and blue mushrooms regrow with a probability of 0.6 when a blue mushroom is eaten. Orange mushrooms have a guaranteed regrowth rate of 1 when consumed.
Each type of mushroom has a specific digestion time. Purple mushrooms are digested instantly, green mushrooms take 5 steps, and blue mushrooms take 10 steps to digest. Unharvested mushrooms spoil after a certain number of time steps: purple mushrooms spoil after 75 steps, green mushrooms after 100 steps, and blue mushrooms after 200 steps.
