I am in a mysterious grid world. In this world, there are the following elements:
Purple Mushroom: This object can be consumed by any agent. Consuming a purple mushroom grants a reward of 1. Purple mushrooms regenerate with a probability of 0.25 when any mushroom is eaten and are digested instantly. They spoil after 75 time steps if unharvested.
Green Mushroom: Consuming a green mushroom provides a reward of 2, which is divided among all agents within a proximity of 2 tiles. Green mushrooms regenerate with a probability of 0.4 when a green or blue mushroom is eaten. They take 5 steps to digest and spoil after 100 time steps if unharvested.
Blue Mushroom: A blue mushroom offers a reward of 3, distributed among all agents within a proximity of 2 tiles, except the one who consumed it. Blue mushrooms regenerate with a probability of 0.6 when a blue mushroom is eaten. They take 10 steps to digest and spoil after 200 time steps if unharvested.
Orange Mushroom: Consuming an orange mushroom destroys purple mushrooms with a 25% probability and grants 3 points to the consumer. Orange mushrooms regenerate with a probability of 1 when consumed and have unique digestion periods.
Floor (Symbol: D): Represents the basic terrain of the grid world where mushrooms can appear according to specific regeneration rules.
Wall (Symbols: n, W, S): These tiles delimit the grid world at the top, the left, the bottom, and the right. Walls are impassable and define the boundaries of the playable area.
The grid world is composed of 14 rows and 23 columns. The tiles start from the [0, 0] position located at the top left and finish at the [13, 22] position located at the bottom right.
