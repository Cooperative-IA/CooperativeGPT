Two players navigate a room to collect colored coins (red and yellow). These coins appear randomly throughout the room at regular intervals.  When a player collects a coin, they earn a reward of 1. However, if a player collects a coin matching the color of the other player, the other player receives a penalty of -2. Each player is assigned a color team.
