I am in a misterious grid world. Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.
The goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).
