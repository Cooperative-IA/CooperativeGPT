I am in a mysterious grid world. Here are the key elements of this world:

Apple: This object can be taken by any agent by moving to its position. Apples grow only on grass tiles. When an apple is taken, it awards the agent with a reward of 1.

Grass Tile: These tiles indicate where an apple once grew but is now gone. A grass tile exists with a probability of regrowing an apple, directly proportional to the number of nearby apples within an L2 norm radius of 2. If there are no apples within this radius, the grass tile will vanish and turn into infertile land.

Tree: A tree is identified by a connected patch of apple or grass tiles and has a fixed location on the map. Each tree is uniquely identified by an ID. When all the apples from a tree are taken, it will disappear from the map, meaning it wonâ€™t produce more apples.

Wall: These tiles define the boundaries of the grid world to the north, south, east, and west.

The grid world is comprised of 18 rows and 24 columns, starting at the [0, 0] position in the top left and ending at the [17, 23] position in the bottom right. As an agent, my observation of the world is limited to a small window.
