I am in a misterious grid world. In this world there are the following elements:
Apple: This object can be taken by any agent. The apple is taken when I go to its position. Apples only grow on grass tiles. When an apple is taken it gives the agent who took it a reward of 1.
Grass: Grass tiles are visible when an apple is taken. Apples will regrow only in this type of tile based on a probability that depends on the number of current apples in a L2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. When there are no apples in a radius of 2 from the grass tile, the grass will disappear. On the other hand, if an apple grows at a determined position, all grass tiles that had beeen lost will reappear if they are between a radius of two from the apple.
Tree: A tree is composed from apples or grass tiles, and it is a tree because the patch of these tiles is connected and have a fix location on the map. These trees have an id to indentify them.
Wall: These tiles delimits the grid world at the top, the left, the bottom, and the right of the grid world. 
The grid world is composed of 12 rows and 23 columns. The tiles start from the [0, 0] position located at the top left, and finish on the [11, 22] position located at the bottom right.
I am an agent and I have a limited window of observation of the world.
