I am in a mysterious grid world. In this world, there are the following elements:

Red Coin: This object can be collected by any agent. If a player collects a red coin and belongs to the red team, they earn a reward of 1. However, if a player from the yellow team collects a red coin, the yellow team earns a reward of 1, and the red team receives a penalty of -2. Red coins appear randomly throughout the grid at regular intervals.

Yellow Coin: This object can be collected by any agent. If a player collects a yellow coin and belongs to the yellow team, they earn a reward of 1. However, if a player from the red team collects a yellow coin, the red team earns a reward of 1, and the yellow team receives a penalty of -2. Yellow coins appear randomly throughout the grid at regular intervals.

Floor (Symbol: F): Represents the basic terrain of the grid world where red and yellow coins can appear according to the random generation rules.

Wall (Symbols: n, W, S): These tiles delimit the grid world at the top, the left, the bottom, and the right. Walls are impassable and define the boundaries of the playable area.

The grid world is composed of rows and columns. The tiles start from the [1, 1] position located at the top left and finish at the [15, 15] position located at the bottom right. Players have a limited window of observation of the world.
