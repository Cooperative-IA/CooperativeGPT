Juan's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a 𝐿2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

With the information given above, asign to each observation of the environment an importance factor
from 1-10, where 1 is the least important and 10 is the most important. The importance factor should
be based on the current relevant memories and what you consider will reflect a better
rewarding outcome for Juan to achieve the plan, take in account also the agent position, which is (7, 16). 

Then, using only the observations with an importance factor of greater or equal than 7,
create a sequence of 3 actions that Juan should take to get closer to achieve the plan. 
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from memories or observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name)', 'go to the tree (treeId) at (x,y)', 'explore']

Important: if you consider there is not enough information to create a sequence of actions,
your answer should be one only action, and it must to be "explore".

Laura's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a 𝐿2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

With the information given above, asign to each observation of the environment an importance factor
from 1-10, where 1 is the least important and 10 is the most important. The importance factor should
be based on the current relevant memories and what you consider will reflect a better
rewarding outcome for Laura to achieve the plan, take in account also the agent position, which is (7, 7). 

Then, using only the observations with an importance factor of greater or equal than 7,
create a sequence of 3 actions that Laura should take to get closer to achieve the plan. 
Each action you determinate can only be one of the following, make sure you assign a valid position from memories or observations and a valid name for each action:

Valid actions: 
['grab apple (x,y)', 'attack player (player_name)', 'go to the tree (treeId) at (x,y)', 'explore']

Important: if you consider there is not enough information to create a sequence of actions,
your answer should be one only action, and it must to be "explore".

2023-10-12 01:45:48,279 - INFO - llm.base_llm - Prompt: You have this information about an agent called Pedro:

Pedro's world understanding: Your are a controller Game Master. Your responsibilities involves overseeing and directing the immediate actions of specific agents. Each decision you make should carefully consider the individual behavior of each agent, the primary objective of each scenario, and the rules of the entire environment.

Scenario: Apples are spread around and can be consumed for a reward of 1. Apples that have been consumed regrow with a per-step probability that depends on the number of current apples in a 𝐿2 norm neighborhood of radius 2. As a consequence, a patch of apples that collectively doesn't have other apples within a distance of 2 from them, can be irrevocably lost if all apples in the patch are consumed. Therefore, agents must exercise restraint when consuming apples within a patch. Each apple tree contains multiple apples.

Roles: 
There are 1 kind of roles in this scenario : (Consumer). Each role has its own valid actions and an agent have to act according to his role.
- Consumer role: The primary goal of a Consumer agent is to maximize their reward by efficiently collecting apples and avoiding unnecessary actions.

Considerations and constrains:
- An agent can only attack another agent if he is at least 3 steps upward from you.

Remember, the goal for each agent in this world is to maximize its rewards (gathered apples).

Recent analysis of past observations:


Current observations: 

Current plan: None

With the information given above, generate a new plan and new objectives to persuit. The plan should be a description of how Pedro should behave in the long-term to maximize its wellbeing.
The plan should include how to act to different situations observed in past experiences.

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema, including the leading and trailing "```json" and "```", answer as if you were Pedro:

```json
{
 "Reasoning": string \\ Step by step thinking and analysis of all the observations and the current plan to create the new plan and the new goals
 "Goals": string \\ The new goals for Pedro
 "Plan": string \\ The new plan for Pedro
}```
